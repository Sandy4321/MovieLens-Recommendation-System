# MovieLens-Recommendation-System-with-Spark-Machine-Learning
Key Words: Recommender System, Machine Learning, Learning to Rank.

Tools: Spark, AWS, SQL

In this notebook, we use Spark and the Spark machine learning library to build a distributed collaborative filtering recommender system for movies with a data set from MovieLens. We tuned the parameters using grid search and implemented the learning to rank metric Normalized Discounted Gain (NDCG) for model evaluation. I deployed the system on AWS cloud computing platform.
